* **(Oct 2, 2023)** 
  * Base python codes for the novel algorithms in [Elemantra](), along with annotated datasets, are released.

## Dependencies

Refer `requirements.txt` for the required essential packages.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data

Configure the datapaths in config.yaml for each task (i.e. seismic-based elephant detection, modified bee sound-based elephant repelling and infrared signature-based elephant detection) as in the folder structure of this repository after adding more data points, especially for seismic-based elephant detection and modified bee sound-based elephant repelling, as required. 

Note: The sample data for bee sound processing and seismic signal processing are in sample_bee_sounds (retrieved from [here](https://zenodo.org/record/1321278)) and sample_seismic_data folders (retrieved from [here](https://zenodo.org/record/4642565)) respectively. The annotated dataset for infrared image-based elephant detection is in the dataset: elephant_detection (the respective images are collected from [here](https://github.com/arribada/human-wildlife-conflict) and annotated by this project). Therefore, if you use, by any means, data and/or proposed algorithms, please cite the above sources accordingly, along with our work. 

## Usage

Execute the tasks
```
# execute entire pipeline with default task: seismic-based elephant detection
python3 main.py
```
Other forms of execution
```
# execute entire pipeline for the task: modified bee sound-based elephant repelling. Note that the spectrogram correlation calculations usually takes a considerable time to execute
python3 main.py --task=bee-modify
```
