## Dependencies

Refer `requirements.txt` for the required essential packages.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data

Datasets are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dAH9R3XDV0z69Bz6lBaftmJJyuckbPmR?usp=sharing). Run the command below to download all the datasets (ShapeNetRender, ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, ShapeNetPart) to reproduce the results.

```
cd data
source download_data.sh
```

## Train CrossPoint

Refer `scripts/script.sh` for the commands to train CrossPoint.

## Downstream Tasks

### 1. 3D Object Classification 

Run `eval_ssl.ipynb` notebook to perform linear SVM object classification in both ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN datasets.


### 2. Few-Shot Object Classification

Refer `scripts/fsl_script.sh` to perform few-shot object classification.

### 3. 3D Object Part Segmentation

Refer `scripts/script.sh` for fine-tuning experiment for part segmentation in ShapeNetPart dataset.
